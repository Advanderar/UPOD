1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose

UPOD is designed to make easier for student to access physics equations, definitions, explanations, and diagrams. As well as giving professors the ability of updating existing information, and adding new information.

1.2 Scope

The Undergraduate Physics Online Database (UPOD) is an online physics database targeted at university students and professors. It's user interface (UI) is designed to allow for easy access and updating. UPOD will give students the ability to learn about multiple physics topics, through the use of interactive diagrams, pictures, videos, equations, definitions, and explanations. Professors will be able to add to the students’ learning experience by creating and editing topic pages.
The goal for UPOD is to make it accessible to everyone. This includes applying it to school servers, and have people login using their school login information.


1.3 Definitions

Front-end: The section of the website that all users are able to access and interact with.
#also the HTML, CSS etc. that the fronted team writes.
Back-end: The section of the website that sends info from the database to the front-end. Administrators and Moderators are the only users able to access this section of the website.
#You don't have to include which users can access the backend, I'll include that in section 2.3.
