UPOD Software Requirements

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose

UPOD is designed to make easier for student to access physics equations, definitions, explanations, and diagrams. As well as giving professors the ability of updating existing information, and adding new information.

1.2 Scope

The Undergraduate Physics Online Database (UPOD) is an online physics database targeted at university students and professors. It's user interface (UI) is designed to allow for easy access and updating. UPOD will give students the ability to learn about multiple physics topics, through the use of interactive diagrams, pictures, videos, equations, definitions, and explanations. Professors will be able to add to the students’ learning experience by creating and editing topic pages.
The goal for UPOD is to make it accessible to everyone. This includes applying it to school servers, and have people login using their school login information.


1.3 Definitions

Front-end: The section of the website that all users are able to access and interact with.

Back-end: The section of the website that sends info from the database to the front-end. Administrators and Moderators are the only users able to access this section of the website.

2.1 Product Perspective

The UPOD site is to be self contained supplying its own front and back end. However, UPOD will be integrated into a Laurier Service as to utilize the Single Sign On authentication service provided by idp.wlu.ca.
UPOD will host full support for the following browsers
	- Firefox 28
	- Chrome 21
	- Safari 6.1
	- Opera 12.1
	- MS Edge 11
And partial support for
	- Internet Explorer 10
	- iOS Safari 7.1
	- Android Browser 4.4
	- Samsung Internet 5
UPOD's user interface will run almost exclusively for desktop computers with some, to no, support for mobile browsers. This is primarely because of non resizable elements such as animated and interactable diagrams that will be too large for mobile interfaces.
UPOD's user interface will contain a search bar, for finding relevent pages; a drop down menu, for secondary site functions such as the moderators panel and about; and a table of contents, consiting of links for navigating each individual pages sections.
UPOD will require a database, to hold information; a server, for generating pages and fufilling user requests; and a browser, for viewing the site.
